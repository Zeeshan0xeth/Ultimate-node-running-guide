# 100 BASIC TOOLS, TERMS TO KNOW AND SOFTWERE NECESSARY FOR NODERUNNING.
- Ubuntu : means “Linux distribution”
This is one of the most popular operating systems for servers and node running.
e.g. A VPS with Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 is often required for testnets.
It’s stable, secure, and widely supported.

- Terminal : means “command-line interface”
Used to type in and run commands that control your system.
e.g. cd, ls, wget — all happen in the terminal.
This is where all node magic begins.


- SSH : means “Secure Shell”
Used to connect securely to your server from anywhere.
e.g. ssh root@your.vps.ip
This gives you remote control over the VPS where your node lives.


- VPS : means “Virtual Private Server”
It’s your personal remote computer in the cloud where your node runs.
Examples: Contabo, Hetzner, DigitalOcean.
e.g. a node needs 16GB RAM and 400GB SSD on a VPS.


- Docker : means “container system”
Used to run software in isolated environments called containers.
e.g. docker run aztecprotocol/aztec
This helps avoid “it works on my machine” problems.


- Docker Compose : means “Docker manager for multiple services”
Used to manage multi-container setups with one config file.
e.g. docker-compose up -d
This spins up several services (like validator + RPC) at once.

- wget : means “web get”
Used to download files directly from a link.
e.g. wget https://github.com/project.tar.gz
This grabs installation scripts or packages.

e.g. curl -X POST http://localhost:8545
This is useful for testing if your RPC is live.

- screen : means “terminal session manager”

They show what your node is doing and any errors.
e.g. docker logs -f aztec-node
This is how you troubleshoot syncing or peer issues.

- Syncing : means “downloading blockchain history”
Your node must sync to the current block before fully working.
Can take hours or days depending on chain.
e.g. Aztec, Ethereum, and Mina need full sync.

- Ports : means “entry points for data”
Each service (like RPC, P2P, Metrics) uses a different port.
e.g. Port 8545 for RPC, 30303 for Ethereum P2P
You need to open these in your VPS firewall.

- Firewall : means “traffic filter”
Controls which ports and IPs can access your node.
e.g. ufw allow 8545
Keep your node secure by only allowing needed traffic.

Used to automate node restarts or checks.
e.g. crontab -e then add @reboot26  docker start mynode
Keeps your node up even after a reboot.

e.g. your node connects to others to sync blocks.
Each node helps others stay up to date.

- Seed Phrase : means “wallet recovery phrase”
A 12–24 word backup that unlocks your wallet or node identity.
e.g. gospel suggest sad actor ...
Must be stored securely — it’s your private key.

Important when interacting with RPCs and other nodes.
Lower latency = faster performance.
Too much latency can drop peers or slow syncing.

- Uptime : means “how long your node stays online”

In staking networks, going offline or cheating can cost you stake.
e.g. Ethereum or Solana slashing.
Not common in testnets, but serious on mainnet.

Nodes often expose metrics (CPU, memory, sync status) via ports.
e.g. localhost:9100/metrics
Can be visualized using Prometheus or Grafana.

- Prometheus : means “metrics collector”
A tool that gathers and monitors your node’s performance.
Often used with Grafana for dashboards.
e.g. docker-compose up prometheus grafana.

Some nodes need 8+ cores and 32GB RAM.
Check project docs before running on low-tier VPS.
Monitor usage with top or htop.

- Snapshot Restore : means “importing a pre-synced backup”
Used to skip full chain sync.
e.g. docker cp snapshot.tar.gz /data && tar -xvzf snapshot.tar.gz
Saves time and bandwidth.

- Ports (Opening/Forwarding) : means “unlocking network entry points”
To make your node publicly accessible, ports like 30303 (P2P), 8545 (RPC), or 26656 (Tendermint) must be open.
e.g. ufw allow 30303/tcp
Without open ports, your node won’t connect to peers.

Used to manage network rules on Ubuntu.
e.g. sudo ufw allow ssh and sudo ufw enable
Protects your node from unwanted traffic.

- Load Average : means “system demand”
Shows how much work your system is doing over 1, 5, and 15 mins.
e.g. 1.50 0.70 0.45 — higher = heavier load.
Use uptime or top to check this.

- htop : means “interactive system monitor”
Like Task Manager for Linux in your terminal.
e.g. htop
Shows CPU, memory, tasks, and lets you kill processes.

Prevents your logs from growing too big.
e.g. system logs rotate weekly by default.
Essential to avoid disk overflow on VPS.

- Symlink : means “shortcut to a file or folder”
e.g. ln -s /path/to/folder shortcut
Useful in node setups where paths change but configs expect a static one.

Used in scripts, Docker, or CLIs to avoid hardcoding secrets.
e.g. export NODE_KEY=xyz123
Safer and more flexible.

Runs setup tasks when a container starts.
e.g. entrypoint.sh might load your .env, pull genesis, and start syncing.

- Node Upgrade : means “switching to a newer version”
Required when testnets release fixes or mainnets fork.
e.g. stop node, pull new binary, restart.
Always follow changelogs before upgrading.

- Rollback : means “return to old version”
If a new version breaks your node, you may revert to a stable backup or older image.
e.g. use an older Docker tag: aztec:v1.3.2
Always keep backups.

- CPU : means “Central Processing Unit”
The brain of your node — handles computation, consensus, encryption, and API responses.
e.g. multi-core (4–16 core) CPUs like AMD Ryzen or Intel Xeon are preferred.
More threads = smoother syncing and better multitasking.

- RAM : means “Random Access Memory”
Temporary memory used for fast operations.
e.g. 16GB RAM minimum is often required for nodes like Celestia, Aleo, or Fhenix.
More RAM = faster syncs, fewer crashes, more container headroom.

- Storage (SSD) : means “Solid State Drive”
Fast, reliable storage is non-negotiable.
e.g. Ethereum archival nodes need 1–2TB NVMe SSDs.
Avoid HDDs — they bottleneck syncs and kill node health.
